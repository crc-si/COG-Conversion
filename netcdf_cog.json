     "The Fractional Cover (FC) algorithm was developed by the Joint",
     "Remote Sensing Research Program and is described in Scarth et al. (2010).",
     "It has been implemented by Geoscience Australia for every observation from",
     "Landsat Thematic Mapper (Landsat 5), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (Landsat 7)",
     "and Operational Land Imager (Landsat 8) acquired since 1987. It is calculated",
     "from terrain corrected surface reflectance (SR-NT_25_2.0.0).  FC_25 provides",
     "a 25m scale fractional cover representation of the proportions of green",
     "vegetation, non-green vegetation, and bare surface cover across the",
     "Australian continent. The fractions are retrieved by inverting multiple",
     "linear regression estimates and using synthetic endmembers in a constrained",
     "non-negative least squares unmixing model. For further information please",
     "see the articles below describing the method implemented which are free to",
